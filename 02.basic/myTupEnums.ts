// const user:(string | number)[] = [1,"kb"]
//we can use it like above but their are some condition where we need 
//data should be come in a setain order but in this type order is
//not compulsery 

// let tUser:[string,number,boolean]

// tUser = ["kb",13,true]

// const rgb:[number,number,number] = [255,255,255]

// type User = [number,string]
// const newUser :User = [112,"krishna@gmail.com"]
//you can override the value
// newUser[1] = "kb.com"

//when you use tupple at that time you define its order of type 
//so if you are defining it just two then that means it will take the 
//array length as just 2 and other elements will be not alloweded
//but if you push unshift or you do any array operation on it
//it will work
